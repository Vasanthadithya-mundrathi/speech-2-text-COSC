## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm
- Deepgram API key

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
# Copy .env.example to .env and add your Deepgram API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file and add your DEEPGRAM_API_KEY

# Start the server
npm start
```

The server will start on port 3001 by default.

### Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Deepgram API key:

```bash
# Deepgram API Key
# Get your API key from https://deepgram.com/
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here

# Server Port (optional)
PORT=3001
```

**Important:** Never commit your actual API key to version control. The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore`.
